# Plex Free Channels M3U

Playlists regenerate **every 8 hours** with fresh anonymous Plex tokens (to maximize stream uptime).  
If channels stop working after ~12–24 hours, reload/refresh the playlist in your IPTV player.

**Important:**
- Free ad-supported channels only (~50–150 working, mostly global + US-heavy)
- Many channels geo-restricted → best with US VPN/location
- Streams may expire or 403 after short time (anonymous limits)
- Refresh playlist daily in your IPTV player

**Main URLs:**

- All regions:

- US-focused:
